# Steam Media project
The Stream Media website will have a registration and login system and hosts various type of media content.
## Problem Statement
A Media Creator/Filmmaker has many types of media content such as films,
trailers, music videos, short stories and books.
These Contents are hosted on diverse platforms and accessible in
different ways and forms such as YouTube (free to watch) or Amazon (on demand
or with Prime membership) or on physical media such as DVDs or books.

How does the Media Creator/filmmaker go about letting his audience
know what is available and accessibility and where? Stream Media website
will provide a centralized platform for his customers to access
all the content and learn more about them. It will provide an administrator
a way to create, read, update and delete some the content and customers
links, embedded videos or even exclusive content when logged in on
Stream Media website. The high-level navigation of the website is as follow:
home, media, frequently asked questions (FAQ) and Account.
